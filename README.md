# :trophy: Daily Coding Challenges

This repository is where I collect my daily coding challenge solutions. I push at least seven solutions per week.
If you want to work on the same kata as I have, please feel free to visit my [profile](https://www.codewars.com/users/jamesPBradley/completed) and view my completed list.

## :thinking: How and Why?

I do at least one challenge every day and push the solution to GitHub.

I do daily challenges for a few reasons:
* I love a good puzzle and I am addicted to working through the challenges on codewars!
* Daily practice = repetition of core concepts
* What better way to deepen my understanding of a language than to use it?

## :notebook: Optimizations

These challenges are a study aid for me, so you may see multiple solutions per file. As I learn, I return to problems and refactor solutions.

## Lessons Learned

* I strive for daily growth - these challenges are a reminder that failure is part of the process. If I struggle with one of the challenges, I learn from it and continue trucking.
