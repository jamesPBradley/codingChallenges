# :trophy: Daily Coding Challenges

This repository is where I collect my daily coding challenge solutions.

## :thinking: Why?

I do daily challenges for a few reasons:
* I love a good puzzle and these can be completed faster than crosswords
* I strive for daily growth - these challenges are a reminder that failure is part of the process
* Daily practice = repetition of core concepts
* What better way to deepen my understanding of a language than to use it?

## :notebook: Some Notes

If you want to work on the same kata as I have, please feel free to visit my [profile](https://www.codewars.com/users/jamesPBradley/completed) and view my completed list.

I **love** friendly competition, so if you're aiming for my spot on the leaderboard, feel free to follow me there. Let me know so I can follow you back.

These challenges are a study aid for me, so you may see multiple solutions per file. As I learn, I return to problems and refactor solutions.

### Thanks for checking these out!
